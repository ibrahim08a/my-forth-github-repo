        <p>for the first time the street of gaza were clean, there 
            wasn't a paper or a cardboard. people were collecting
            the paper from the street to use it for baking, because the electricity
            was disconnected. my mum didn't want to bake and she asked me to bring
            bread from the oven. the queue at the oven stratched form gaza to
            the west bank. people would line up for 8 hour to get t heir turn 
            and teke half a pack of bred.</p>
